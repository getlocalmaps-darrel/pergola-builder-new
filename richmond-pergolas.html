            <p class="section-subtitle">
              In Richmond, the sun comes in low over open fields, lakes and greenbelts, and afternoon heat can make a
              bare patio unusable. Our job as your <strong>Richmond pergola builder</strong> is to design a structure
              that fits the way the sun hits your yard, your HOA guidelines and how your family actually uses the space
              – not just what looks good in a catalog.
            </p>

            <div class="inner-intro-body">
              <p>
                We regularly build <strong>custom pergolas in Richmond neighborhoods</strong> such as Aliana, Harvest
                Green, Pecan Grove, Long Meadow Farms and Waterside Estates. Each community has its own architectural
                style and HOA rules, so we match posts, beams and finishes to your home and subdivision instead of a
                one-size-fits-all layout.
              </p>
              <p>
                During an on-site visit we’ll walk your patio, look at doors, windows and roof lines, and see how the
                hottest sun and prevailing wind hit your yard. From there, we outline options like
                <strong>cedar pergolas, painted wood pergolas or hybrid patio covers</strong> and give you realistic
                price ranges and timelines before you commit.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Custom wood &amp; cedar pergolas</strong> sized for Richmond patios, pools and corner lots</li>
                <li><strong>Pergolas for outdoor kitchens</strong> and grill stations near Aliana &amp; Harvest Green amenities</li>
                <li><strong>Pergola extensions</strong> that expand undersized builder patio covers into real outdoor rooms</li>
                <li><strong>Freestanding pergolas</strong> that create a destination away from the back door or pool edge</li>
                <li>Help with <strong>HOA approvals for Richmond communities</strong> so your project moves forward smoothly</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If you’d like, we can point out <strong>pergolas we’ve built in Richmond</strong> so you can drive by,
                see beam sizes and colors in person and get a feel for what makes sense on your own lot, pool and patio.

                Start by looking for a <strong>local pergola contractor</strong> who already works in Richmond
                communities like Aliana, Harvest Green, Pecan Grove and Long Meadow Farms. Ask for addresses of recent
                pergola projects you can actually drive by, not just a few cropped photos.
                <br /><br />
                A good <strong>Richmond pergola builder</strong> will be able to talk specifically about your side of
                Grand Parkway, your subdivision’s style and how the sun and wind move across backyards near the Brazos
                River. Then compare written estimates so you can see differences in beam sizes, posts and finishes—not
                just the final number.

                The easiest way is to call or text Pergola Builder Houston with photos of your Richmond patio, pool
                or yard along with rough measurements. Let us know which community you’re in so we understand typical
                home styles and HOA expectations.
                <br /><br />
                From there we schedule an on-site visit when needed, confirm dimensions and shade angles, and then send
                a <strong>written, itemized pergola estimate</strong> so you can compare options and pricing with other
                Richmond pergola contractors.

                For most <strong>Richmond pergolas</strong> we recommend cedar or properly treated wood. These materials
                handle the heat, humidity and storms that roll through Fort Bend County, and they can be stained or
                painted to match your brick, stone and trim.
                <br /><br />
                During your estimate we can compare <strong>cedar vs painted wood</strong> for your project, talk
                about maintenance, and show real examples of each style so you can decide which look fits your Richmond
                home long term.

                We regularly help homeowners prepare the drawings and material descriptions needed for

                <strong>Richmond pergola pricing</strong> depends on the size of the structure, height, beam and post
                sizes, wood species, stain or paint and whether we are building over a basic patio slab or integrating
                with a pool or outdoor kitchen.
                <br /><br />
                Simple wood pergolas typically fall in the lower range, while larger cedar pergolas with upgraded posts,
                lighting or privacy screens cost more. A written estimate is the best way to understand exact pricing
                for your yard and wish list.

                Big-box pergola kits can be tempting, but most were not designed around Richmond wind loads, soil
                conditions or HOA standards. A <strong>custom pergola</strong> can be sized correctly for your slab,
                furniture and views while using posts, beams and connections suited for our weather.
                <br /><br />
                When you compare all-in costs, many homeowners find that a custom pergola from a local builder is a
                smarter long-term investment than a kit assembled on a weekend.

                Once materials are ready and any required HOA approvals are in place, most <strong>Richmond pergola projects</strong>
                are built in just a few days. The schedule depends on structure size, weather and whether we’re working
                around a pool, existing patio cover or outdoor kitchen.

                To compare pergola builder prices fairly in Richmond, request <strong>written, itemized estimates</strong>
                from two or three local contractors. Each quote should list structure dimensions, post and beam sizes,

                That way you can see exactly where the differences in price come from and choose the pergola builder
