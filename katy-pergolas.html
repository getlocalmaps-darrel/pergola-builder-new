            <p class="section-subtitle">
              In Katy, the sun hits hard across wide, open backyards. Our job as your <strong>local pergola builder</strong>
              is to design a structure that works with your slab, pool, and the way the afternoon sun rolls across your
              yard—not just a generic kit from a big-box store.
            </p>

            <div class="inner-intro-body">
              <p>
                We build <strong>custom pergolas in Katy neighborhoods</strong> like Cinco Ranch, Elyson, Firethorne,
                Tamarron and Pine Mill Ranch. Every project starts with a site visit so we can see how your patio sits
                against the house, where you get glare, and which directions the best breezes come from.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then we talk through whether you’re better off with a <strong>cedar pergola</strong>, painted wood
                pergola or a hybrid patio cover. We’ll explain realistic <strong>Katy pergola pricing</strong>, permits
                and HOA approvals so you know the full investment before saying yes.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Custom wood &amp; cedar pergolas</strong> tailored to Katy’s heat, humidity and wind</li>
                <li><strong>Patio pergolas</strong> that make small builder slabs feel like real outdoor rooms</li>
                <li><strong>Pergola construction around pools and outdoor kitchens</strong> in Katy backyards</li>
                <li><strong>Pergola extensions</strong> that expand undersized builder patio covers</li>
                <li>Help with <strong>HOA approval for Katy communities</strong> so your project isn’t delayed</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                During your estimate, we can point out nearby projects so you can <strong>drive by real pergolas in
                Katy</strong> we’ve built. Seeing the scale, posts and beams in person makes it easier to picture what
                will work best on your own patio.

                  A warm <strong>cedar pergola</strong> over an existing concrete patio—sized so it clears doors and
                  windows while still shading the main seating area on hot Katy afternoons.

                Look for a <strong>local pergola contractor</strong> who already works in Katy neighborhoods like
                Cinco Ranch, Elyson, Firethorne, Tamarron or Old Katy. Ask for recent pergola addresses you can drive
                by, not just a few photos online. A reputable <strong>Katy pergola builder</strong> should have multiple
                projects nearby and 5-star reviews mentioning communication and clean job sites.
                <br /><br />
                Then compare their designs and estimates with others serving the Katy area. Make sure they explain beam
                sizes, post spacing, stain or paint options and who handles HOA approvals for your specific community.

                The easiest way is to call or text Pergola Builder Houston with photos and rough dimensions of your

                <br /><br />
                We typically schedule an on-site visit to confirm measurements, sun angles and wind exposure. Then we

                Katy contractors.

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                For most <strong>Katy pergolas</strong> we recommend cedar or properly treated wood. These materials
                handle intense sun, can be stained or painted and feel warm and natural next to brick and stone homes.
                Aluminum or vinyl pergolas can work, but they often feel hotter and more like kit structures.
                <br /><br />
                During your estimate we’ll compare <strong>cedar vs aluminum pergolas for Katy</strong>, cover
                maintenance and show nearby examples so you can see the difference in person.

                Many Katy master-planned communities—including Cinco Ranch and Firethorne—require

                rules about how close you can build to fences or easements.
                <br /><br />
                We regularly help homeowners gather the layout, elevations and material specs needed for Katy HOA
                approvals so the project doesn’t get delayed after you’ve already picked a design.

                <strong>Katy pergola pricing</strong> depends on the size of the structure, post and beam sizes, wood

                <br /><br />
                Simple wood patio pergolas typically fall in the lower range, while large cedar pergolas with upgraded
                posts, lighting or privacy screens cost more. We provide a line-item estimate so you can see how each
                decision changes the overall price.

                Big-box pergola kits can look affordable on paper, but once you factor in upgraded materials, hardware

                investment.
                <br /><br />
                Custom builds let us set posts and beams correctly for your soil, wind and layout. That’s especially
                important in open Katy neighborhoods where the wind really moves across the back of the house.

                Once HOA approval and materials are ready, most <strong>Katy pergola projects</strong> are built in a
                matter of days, not months. The timeline depends on size, weather and whether we’re tying into an
                outdoor kitchen or pool project.
                <br /><br />
                When we meet, we’ll give you a realistic start date and completion window so you can plan around family
                events, pool openings and holidays.

                Ask each contractor to provide a <strong>written, itemized estimate</strong> that lists dimensions,

Then compare written estimates so you understand the differences in pergola size, materials and HOA support, not just price."
