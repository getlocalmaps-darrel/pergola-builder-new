            <p class="section-subtitle">
              A good <strong>patio cover</strong> does more than shade part of the slab. It extends your living space,
              protects furniture, and lets you actually use your backyard when Houston weather turns hot, bright or
              stormy. Our job as your <strong>patio contractor</strong> is to design a structure that ties into your
              home and feels like it was always meant to be there.
            </p>

            <div class="inner-intro-body">
              <p>
                At Pergola Builder Houston, we build <strong>wood-framed patio covers, patio enclosures, patio
                extensions and cedar pergolas</strong> that match your home’s style and roof lines. Because we’re a
                local, design-to-build contractor, we think through shade, drainage, wind and HOA rules before anything
                gets built.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether you’re starting from a builder-grade slab or extending an existing porch, we help you understand
                the real <strong>patio construction prices and costs</strong> for your size, materials and options—no
                guesswork, no one-size-fits-all kits.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Patio covers</strong> that tie into your roofline or stand alone with properly sized posts
                  and beams
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Patio enclosures</strong> with walls, screens or privacy features for extra protection
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Patio extensions</strong> that make small, builder slabs feel like real outdoor living rooms
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Outdoor patio construction</strong> around kitchens, fire pits, pool decks and seating areas
                </li>
                <li>
                  Integration with <strong>wood and cedar pergolas</strong> when you want both full shade and filtered light
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                On your first visit, we walk your backyard (Houston, Katy, Cypress, Sugar Land, etc.), look at the way
                the sun hits the patio, talk through how you want to use the space and help you compare
                <strong>best patio covers</strong> for our climate. We can show addresses of recent projects so you can
                see finished patio covers and extensions in person before you decide.

            These FAQs are written to help you compare <strong>Houston patio contractors</strong>, materials, warranties

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                Start by asking each <strong>patio contractor</strong> for a written, itemized estimate that includes
                size, materials, footing details, roof connection, electrical work and any options like fans or lighting.
                This lets you compare <strong>patio construction prices</strong> based on scope, not just a lump-sum
                number.<br /><br />
                Then ask about <strong>warranties for the patio cover</strong>, structural framing and roof
                materials. A reputable <strong>Houston patio contractor</strong> will clearly explain what is covered,
                for how long, and what is considered normal wear. Also check online for
                <strong>patio construction reviews</strong> so you can see how they handle issues after the job is done.

                In our experience, <strong>wood patio covers</strong> built with properly sized posts and beams, then
                finished with quality roofing materials, perform very well in Houston’s heat and humidity. They can be
                stained, painted or matched to your home’s trim.<br /><br />
                Some homeowners prefer aluminum or composite components in certain situations, but the key is to use
                materials suited to the <strong>Houston climate</strong> with proper flashing, drainage and anchoring. On
                your estimate visit, we’ll walk you through the pros and cons of different options and help you choose
                the <strong>best patio covers</strong> for your home.

                The full timeline has two parts: planning and construction. Planning includes design, HOA approval and
                any permits your city or neighborhood requires. Construction is the hands-on work of building the
                <strong>patio cover or patio extension</strong> itself.<br /><br />
                Once approvals and materials are ready, most <strong>outdoor patio construction</strong> projects are
                completed in days, not months, depending on size and weather. On your estimate, we’ll outline a realistic
                start date and completion window based on your specific project.

                When you meet with a patio builder, consider asking:
                <ul>
                  <li>How many <strong>patio covers</strong> or <strong>patio extensions</strong> they’ve built in your area</li>
                  <li>Whether they offer design consults with drawings or 3D views</li>
                  <li>What materials they recommend for your home and why</li>
                  <li>Typical <strong>patio construction costs</strong> for similar projects</li>
                  <li>Who will be on-site each day and how long construction will take</li>
                </ul>
                These questions help you compare companies beyond price and make sure you’re comfortable with the
                builder’s process and communication.

                A <strong>patio cover</strong> is a roof structure that provides shade and weather protection over your
                existing patio. A <strong>patio enclosure</strong> adds walls, screens or windows to create a more
                protected outdoor room. A <strong>patio extension</strong> enlarges your usable space by extending the
                slab and cover further into the yard.<br /><br />
                During your estimate, we’ll help you decide whether a simple cover, an enclosed space or a full
                extension makes the most sense for how you plan to use your backyard.

This lets you compare patio construction prices based on scope instead of one lump-sum number. Then ask what warranties apply to the patio cover structure, roofing and workmanship, and how long each warranty lasts. Finally, read patio construction reviews online to see how each contractor handles issues after the job is completed."
