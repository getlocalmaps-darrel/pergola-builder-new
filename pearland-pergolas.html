            <p class="section-subtitle">
              Pearland backyards are a mix of <strong>lake lots, greenbelts and cul-de-sacs</strong>. Our job as your
              <strong>Pearland pergola builder</strong> is to design a structure that works with your lot, provides usable
              shade and fits the look of your home and subdivision—not just something that looks good in a catalog.
            </p>

            <div class="inner-intro-body">
              <p>
                We regularly build <strong>custom pergolas in Pearland neighborhoods</strong> like Shadow Creek Ranch,
                Silverlake, Southwyck, Southern Trails and areas along 288, 518 and 35. Each community has its own home
                styles and HOA rules, so we size posts, beams and finishes to your house and yard instead of forcing a
                one-size-fits-all pergola.
              </p>
              <p>
                During an on-site visit we’ll review your patio size, pool layout (if you have one), how the sun moves
                across your yard and how your family uses the space. Then we walk through <strong>cedar pergolas, painted
                wood pergolas and hybrid patio covers</strong>, explaining realistic <strong>Pearland pergola pricing</strong>,
                maintenance and timelines so you know what to expect.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Custom wood &amp; cedar pergolas</strong> sized for Pearland patios and pool decks</li>
                <li><strong>Pergolas for outdoor kitchens</strong> and grill areas off the back of Pearland homes</li>
                <li><strong>Pergola extensions</strong> that turn small builder slabs into real outdoor rooms</li>
                <li><strong>Freestanding pergolas</strong> that create a hangout zone near a lake, greenbelt or side yard</li>
                <li>Help with <strong>HOA approvals for Pearland communities</strong> so your design gets approved quickly</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If you want to see our work in person, we can point out <strong>pergolas we’ve built in Pearland and
                nearby Friendswood and Manvel</strong> so you can drive by, see beam sizes and colors up close and get
                ideas before finalizing your own design.

                Look for a <strong>local pergola contractor</strong> with recent projects in Pearland neighborhoods you
                recognize—Shadow Creek Ranch, Silverlake, Southwyck, Southern Trails or along 288 and 518. Ask for
                addresses you can drive by and check that the builder understands Pearland HOAs, drainage and how the
                sun hits lots in your part of town.
                <br /><br />
                Then compare <strong>written, itemized pergola estimates</strong> so you can see differences in size,
                wood species, beam and post dimensions and finishes instead of trying to guess from a single lump-sum
                number.

                For most <strong>Pearland pergolas</strong> we recommend cedar or properly treated wood. These materials
                handle heat, humidity and storms well, and they can be stained or painted to match your brick, stone or
                siding.
                <br /><br />
                During your estimate we compare <strong>cedar vs painted wood pergolas</strong>, talk about maintenance
                and show real examples so you can choose the look that fits your Pearland home and budget.

                Many Pearland master-planned communities and subdivisions require <strong>HOA approval</strong> before
                you build a pergola or patio cover. They may request drawings, locations, colors and height details.
                <br /><br />
                We regularly help homeowners prepare the drawings and descriptions needed for <strong>Pearland HOA
                approvals</strong> so your pergola is set up to pass on paper before we schedule construction.

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                <strong>Pearland pergola pricing</strong> depends on structure size, height, post and beam sizes, wood
                species, stain or paint and whether we are working over a basic slab, near a pool or tying into an
                outdoor kitchen.
                <br /><br />
                Smaller wood pergolas fall in the lower range, while large cedar pergolas with upgraded beams, lighting
                or privacy screens are a higher investment. A written estimate tailored to your yard is the best way to
                understand exact costs.

                Big-box pergola kits rarely match the scale and style of <strong>Pearland homes</strong>, especially in
                master-planned communities with specific design guidelines. A <strong>custom pergola</strong> can be
                sized for your patio, furniture and views, and built with posts, beams and hardware suited for our
                weather and HOA standards.
                <br /><br />
                When you factor in upgraded materials and professional installation, many Pearland homeowners find a
                custom pergola is a smarter long-term investment than a basic kit.
