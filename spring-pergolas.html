            <p class="section-subtitle">
              Yards in Spring often back up to greenbelts, creeks and wooded areas. Our job as your
              <strong>Spring pergola builder</strong> is to design a structure that works with those views, gives you
              usable shade and meets the expectations of your HOA—not just bolt a generic kit to your concrete.
            </p>

            <div class="inner-intro-body">
              <p>
                We regularly build <strong>custom pergolas in Spring neighborhoods</strong> such as Spring Trails,
                Harmony, Woodson’s Reserve, Gleannloch Farms and communities closer to The Woodlands. Each area has its
                own home styles and guidelines, so we size posts, beams and finishes to match your house and subdivision
                instead of forcing a one-look-fits-all pergola.
              </p>
              <p>
                During an on-site visit we’ll look at your patio size, doors and windows, where you get the most glare
                and how you plan to use the space. Then we’ll walk through <strong>cedar pergolas, painted wood pergolas
                and hybrid patio covers</strong>, explaining realistic <strong>Spring pergola pricing</strong>, options
                and timelines before any work begins.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Custom wood &amp; cedar pergolas</strong> tailored to Spring’s wooded lots and greenbelts</li>
                <li><strong>Pergolas for outdoor kitchens and pools</strong> in Spring and The Woodlands area</li>
                <li><strong>Pergola extensions</strong> that expand small builder patio covers into real outdoor rooms</li>
                <li><strong>Freestanding pergolas</strong> that create a destination away from the back door</li>
                <li>Help with <strong>HOA approvals for Spring communities</strong> so your project doesn’t stall</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If you’d like to see our work in person, we can point out <strong>pergolas we’ve built near Spring</strong>
                so you can drive by, check out beam sizes and colors and get ideas for your own backyard before you
                commit to a design.

                Look for a <strong>local pergola contractor</strong> who already works in Spring communities like Spring
                Trails, Harmony, Woodson’s Reserve or near The Woodlands. Ask for addresses of recent pergola projects
                you can drive by, not just a few cropped photos online.
                <br /><br />
                A good <strong>Spring pergola builder</strong> should be able to talk about your specific subdivision,
                typical lot sizes, tree cover and HOA expectations. Then compare written, itemized estimates so you can
                see differences in size, materials and details instead of guessing from one lump-sum price.

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                For most <strong>Spring, TX pergolas</strong> we recommend cedar or properly treated wood. These
                materials handle heat, humidity and storms, and they can be stained or painted to match brick, stone and
                siding used in Spring neighborhoods.
                <br /><br />
                During your estimate we can compare <strong>cedar vs painted wood pergolas</strong>, discuss
                maintenance and show real examples so you can pick the look that fits your Spring home long term.

                We frequently assist homeowners with the drawings and descriptions needed for <strong>Spring HOA

                <strong>Spring pergola pricing</strong> depends on structure size, height, post and beam sizes, wood

                Smaller wood pergolas cost less, while large cedar pergolas with upgraded beams, lighting and privacy
                screens are a higher investment. A written estimate from a local builder is the best way to understand
                costs for your specific backyard.

                Big-box pergola kits are designed to fit many yards on paper, but they are rarely optimized for Spring’s
                tree cover, wind and soil conditions. A <strong>custom pergola</strong> can be sized properly for your
                patio, furniture and views and built with posts, beams and connections suited for local weather.
                <br /><br />
                When you factor in upgrades and installation, many homeowners find a custom pergola from a Spring-area
                builder is a better long-term value than a kit.

                are built in a few days. The full timeline includes design, HOA review, material ordering and actual

                To compare pergola builder prices fairly in Spring, ask each contractor for a <strong>written, itemized
