            <p class="section-subtitle">
              The Memorial corridor is a mix of <strong>mature trees, custom homes and narrow lots</strong>. Our job as
              your <strong>Memorial pergola builder</strong> is to design a structure that works with your existing
              architecture and trees, softens the afternoon sun and fits within Houston and village-level guidelines—
              not just bolt a generic kit onto your patio.
            </p>

            <div class="inner-intro-body">
              <p>
                We regularly build <strong>custom pergolas in Memorial neighborhoods</strong> including Nottingham Forest,
                Memorial Bend, Frostwood, Wilchester, Lakeside Estates, and pockets of the <strong>Energy Corridor and
                Spring Branch</strong>. Every block has its own character, so we size posts, beams and finishes to match
                your house rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all structure.
              </p>
              <p>
                During an on-site visit we’ll review your patio, rooflines, tree canopy, privacy needs and how the sun
                hits your backyard off I-10 or Beltway 8. Then we walk through <strong>cedar pergolas, painted wood
                pergolas and hybrid patio covers</strong>, explaining realistic <strong>Memorial pergola pricing</strong>
                and timelines so you can plan around remodels and upcoming projects.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Custom wood &amp; cedar pergolas</strong> sized for Memorial’s mature trees and lot lines</li>
                <li><strong>Pergolas for outdoor kitchens and pools</strong> behind Memorial and Spring Branch homes</li>
                <li><strong>Pergola extensions</strong> that add coverage to small or existing builder slabs</li>
                <li><strong>Freestanding pergolas</strong> that create a quiet seating area away from the house</li>
                <li>Help with <strong>deed restrictions and HOA approvals</strong> in Memorial-area neighborhoods</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If you’d like examples, we can point out <strong>pergolas we’ve built near Memorial, the Energy Corridor
                and Spring Branch</strong> so you can drive by, see how they sit with similar homes and get ideas for
                your own backyard before you commit.

                Start by looking for a <strong>local pergola contractor</strong> with recent projects in Memorial
                neighborhoods like Nottingham Forest, Memorial Bend, Frostwood, Wilchester or along the Energy Corridor.
                Ask for addresses you can drive by and verify that the builder understands older Memorial homes, trees,
                drainage and deed restrictions.
                <br /><br />
                Then compare <strong>written, itemized pergola estimates</strong> so you can see differences in size,

                We’ll review your information, schedule an on-site visit when needed and then send a

                For most <strong>Memorial pergolas</strong> we recommend cedar or properly treated wood. These materials
                match the character of older brick and custom homes, handle Gulf Coast humidity and storms, and can be
                stained or painted to blend with existing trim.
                <br /><br />
                During your estimate we compare <strong>cedar vs painted wood pergolas</strong>, explain maintenance,
                and show real examples so you can choose the look that fits your home and street.

                We regularly help homeowners prepare the drawings and descriptions needed for <strong>Memorial-area HOA

                Smaller wood pergolas cost less, while large cedar pergolas with upgraded beams, lighting and privacy
                screens require a higher investment. A written estimate tailored to your yard is the best way to
                understand exact costs.

                Big-box pergola kits are rarely designed for <strong>older Memorial homes, mature trees and unique lot
                shapes</strong>. A <strong>custom pergola</strong> can be sized to clear rooflines, work around trees,
                and look appropriate with the style and scale of your house.
                <br /><br />
                Once you account for upgraded materials and professional installation, many Memorial homeowners find a
                custom pergola to be a better long-term investment than a generic kit that never quite fits the space.

                To compare pergola builder prices fairly in Memorial, ask each contractor for a <strong>written, itemized
