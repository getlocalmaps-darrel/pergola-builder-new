            <p class="section-subtitle">
              In Cypress, yards tend to be wide and open, with strong afternoon sun coming off the lakes and greenbelts.
              Our job as your <strong>Cypress pergola builder</strong> is to design a structure that takes into account
              sun angles, wind, HOA guidelines and how your family actually uses the space—not just a picture from a
              catalog.
            </p>

            <div class="inner-intro-body">
              <p>
                We regularly build <strong>custom pergolas in Cypress neighborhoods</strong> such as Bridgeland, Towne
                Lake, Fairfield, BlackHorse Ranch and Coles Crossing. Each community has its own look and HOA rules,
                so we match posts, beams and finishes to your home and subdivision instead of forcing a one-size-fits-all
                design.
              </p>
              <p>
                During an on-site visit we’ll review your patio size, doors and windows, pool layout and where the
                hottest sun hits your yard. Then we outline options like <strong>cedar pergolas, painted wood pergolas
                or hybrid patio covers</strong>, explaining realistic price ranges and timelines before you commit.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Custom wood &amp; cedar pergolas</strong> sized for Cypress patios, pools and lake lots</li>
                <li><strong>Pergolas for outdoor kitchens</strong> and grilling areas near Towne Lake boardwalks</li>
                <li><strong>Pergola extensions</strong> that expand undersized builder patio covers</li>
                <li><strong>Freestanding pergolas</strong> that create a destination away from the back door</li>
                <li>Help with <strong>HOA approvals for Cypress communities</strong> so your project stays on track</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If you’d like, we can point out <strong>pergolas we’ve built in Cypress</strong> so you can drive by,
                see beam sizes and colors in person and get a feel for what makes sense on your own lot and patio.

                communities like Bridgeland, Towne Lake, Fairfield, BlackHorse Ranch or Coles Crossing. Ask for
                addresses of recent pergola projects you can actually drive by, not just a few cropped photos.
                <br /><br />
                A good <strong>Cypress pergola builder</strong> will be able to talk specifically about your side of

                The easiest way is to call or text Pergola Builder Houston with photos of your Cypress patio, pool or

                From there we schedule an on-site visit when needed, confirm dimensions and shade angles, and then send

                For most <strong>Cypress pergolas</strong> we recommend cedar or properly treated wood. These materials
                handle the heat, humidity and storms that roll through Northwest Houston, and they can be stained or
                painted to match your brick, stone and trim.
                <br /><br />
                During your estimate we can compare <strong>cedar vs painted wood</strong> for your project, talk
                about maintenance and show real examples of each style so you can decide which look fits your Cypress
                home long term.

                <strong>Cypress pergola pricing</strong> depends on the size of the structure, height, beam and post

                with a pool or outdoor kitchen.
                <br /><br />
                Simple wood pergolas typically fall in the lower range, while larger cedar pergolas with upgraded
                posts, lighting or privacy screens cost more. A written estimate is the best way to understand exact
                pricing for your yard and wish list.

                Big-box pergola kits can be tempting, but most were not designed around Cypress wind loads, soil
                conditions or HOA standards. A <strong>custom pergola</strong> can be sized correctly for your slab,
                furniture and views while using posts, beams and connections suited for our weather.
                <br /><br />
                When you compare all-in costs, many homeowners find that a custom pergola from a local builder is a
                smarter long-term investment than a kit assembled on a weekend.

                Once materials are ready and any required HOA approvals are in place, most <strong>Cypress pergola projects</strong>
                are built in just a few days. The schedule depends on structure size, weather and whether we’re working
                around a pool, existing patio cover or outdoor kitchen.

                To compare pergola builder prices fairly in Cypress, request <strong>written, itemized estimates</strong>
                from two or three local contractors. Each quote should list structure dimensions, post and beam sizes,
                materials, stain or paint and any extras like lighting or privacy panels.

                That way you can see exactly where the differences in price come from and choose the pergola builder
