                Look for a pergola contractor or patio contractor who is licensed and insured, has photos of completed projects and understands Houston weather and HOA rules. Ask for a written estimate, a clear timeline and details on the materials and footings they plan to use so your pergola or patio cover holds up long term.

                Pricing depends on size, design, materials and whether the structure is attached to your home or freestanding. A simple wood pergola will cost less than a solid-roof patio cover or a pergola extension tied into an outdoor kitchen. The best way to get accurate pricing is to schedule a free on-site estimate so we can measure your space and talk through options.

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                Yes. Many Houston homeowners choose a pergola or patio cover with an outdoor kitchen, built-in BBQ or bar seating. We can design the structure, run gas and electrical with licensed trades, and build the stone or stucco island so everything works together as one outdoor living space.

                Some pergolas and many solid-roof patio covers require permits or HOA approval. As a patio and pergola contractor, we can help with drawings, engineering and paperwork so your project is approved before construction begins. We will review what is required based on your address and neighborhood.
