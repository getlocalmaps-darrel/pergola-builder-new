            <p class="section-subtitle">
              A good outdoor kitchen is more than a grill sitting on the patio. It’s a planned
              <strong>outdoor living kitchen</strong> with counters, storage, gas, electrical and shade, built to handle
              Houston’s heat, humidity and storms. Our job as your <strong>outdoor kitchen builder</strong> is to get
              all of that right the first time.
            </p>

            <div class="inner-intro-body">
              <p>
                Pergola Builder Houston designs and builds <strong>outdoor kitchens, grill islands and bar areas</strong>
                that are engineered for our climate and local codes. We handle layout, framing, finishes and the details
                that make an outdoor kitchen actually comfortable to cook and hang out in.
              </p>
              <p>
                On your first call, we talk about how you want to use the space, what appliances you’re thinking about
                and whether you already have a patio cover or need one built. We can also show you real projects we’ve
                completed in Houston, Katy, Cypress, Sugar Land and nearby areas so you can see what’s realistic in real
                backyards.

              <p>
                We also build <strong>wood and cedar custom pergolas</strong> and patio covers, so if you want your
                outdoor kitchen under shade or tied into a larger outdoor living plan, we can design everything together
                instead of guessing one piece at a time.

                Basic <strong>outdoor kitchens in Houston</strong> often start around the <strong>$5,000+ range</strong>
                for a simple grill island with storage and counter space, depending on appliances and finishes. Larger
                <strong>outdoor living kitchens</strong> with sinks, refrigeration, bar seating, fireplaces or fire
                features can run well into the five figures or more.<br /><br />
                When you request a quote from Pergola Builder Houston, we provide an <strong>itemized estimate</strong>
                that breaks out structure, finishes, appliances and utilities. This makes it easier to compare
                <strong>outdoor kitchen contractor Houston prices and cost</strong> and to value-engineer the project if
                needed.

                </ul>
                When you compare cost estimates for outdoor kitchens in Houston, ask each contractor to separate those

                electrical circuits, plumbing and venting—each with its own code requirements. You should always ask
                your <strong>outdoor kitchen contractor</strong>:
                <ul>
                  <li>Who handles design, permits and HOA approvals</li>

                For Houston’s heat and humidity, we typically recommend <strong>granite, concrete or porcelain
                countertops</strong> for outdoor kitchens. They’re durable, handle temperature swings well and are
                easier to keep looking clean than softer materials.<br /><br />
                During design, we’ll talk through <strong>best materials for Houston outdoor kitchen countertops</strong>
                based on how much shade you’ll have, how often you cook and what style you want for your outdoor
                living kitchen.

                Houston’s heat, humidity and storms mean you should think beyond just the grill. Important
                <strong>climate considerations for outdoor kitchen materials</strong> include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Non-combustible framing around built-in grills and appliances</li>
                  <li>Weather-resistant countertops and cabinetry</li>
                  <li>Shade from patio covers or pergolas plus ceiling fans for comfort</li>
                  <li>Proper drainage so water doesn’t sit under the kitchen</li>
                  <li>Ventilation for smoke and heat under any cover or roof</li>
                </ul>
                As a local <strong>outdoor kitchen builder</strong>, we design with these Houston-specific factors in
                mind from the beginning.

                Search for phrases like <strong>“outdoor kitchen contractor Houston”</strong> and add your neighborhood

                Ask each contractor for photos of recent outdoor kitchens in your part of town and at least two local

                The timeline depends on design complexity and how many trades are involved. There’s a planning phase
                (design, permits, HOA approval, appliance decisions) and a construction phase. Once approvals and
                materials are set, most <strong>custom outdoor kitchens</strong> are built in days or a few weeks,
