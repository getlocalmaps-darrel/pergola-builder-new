            <p class="section-subtitle">
              You’ve seen pergola photos online, but the real question is: <strong>what will work on your exact
              patio in Houston</strong>? Our job as a local <strong>pergola contractor</strong> is to design and build
              a structure that fits your slab, your HOA and the way the sun hits your backyard.
            </p>

            <div class="inner-intro-body">
              <p>
                Pergola Builder Houston focuses on <strong>custom pergola construction</strong>—not generic, big-box
                kits. As a <strong>wooden pergola builder in Houston</strong>, we’re on back patios in Houston, Katy,
                Cypress and Sugar Land every week, adjusting layouts and beam spacing for real backyards, not
                showroom displays.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ll help you decide whether a <strong>cedar pergola</strong>, painted wood pergola or a hybrid
                patio cover makes the most sense, then walk you through price ranges, permits and timelines so you
                understand the true <strong>pergola builder Houston cost</strong> before you say yes.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Custom wood &amp; cedar pergolas</strong> designed for Houston’s sun, rain and humidity
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Patio pergolas</strong> that upgrade small builder slabs, townhome patios and covered porches
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pergola construction</strong> around outdoor kitchens, fire features and pool seating areas
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pergola extensions</strong> that make undersized builder patio covers actually usable
                </li>
                <li>
                  Guidance on <strong>HOA approval and permitting for Houston pergolas</strong> so there are no surprises

              </ul>

              <p>
                When we visit, we confirm we regularly build in your area, walk your backyard, look at sun angles and
                wind, and talk through how you want to use the space—quiet coffee, big family gatherings or a mix of
                both. We can even share recent pergola addresses in neighborhoods like Houston, Katy, Cypress or Sugar
                Land so you can drive by and see our work in person before you hire us.

                Start by looking for a <strong>local pergola builder or pergola contractor</strong> who is
                already working in your part of town—Houston, Katy, Cypress, Sugar Land, etc. Ask if they regularly
                build in your neighborhood and request at least two recent pergola addresses you can drive by. A
                reputable <strong>wooden pergola builder in Houston</strong> will be happy to share examples.<br /><br />
                Next, look at their portfolio and reviews. Search phrases like
                <strong>“pergola builder Houston reviews”</strong> or
                <strong>“pergola contractor Houston reviews”</strong> and confirm they have consistent 5-star feedback,
                not just one or two good jobs. Finally, ask who handles permits and HOA approval, what materials they
                specialize in and whether they do in-person design consults with drawings.

                pictures.<br /><br />
                From there, we usually schedule an on-site visit so we can confirm measurements, look at sun and wind,
                and talk through materials and options. You’ll receive a <strong>written, itemized estimate</strong>
                that makes it easy to compare scope, not just price, with other <strong>Houston pergola builders</strong>.

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                For most backyards, we recommend <strong>cedar or properly treated wood pergolas</strong>. They handle
                Houston’s heat well, can be stained or painted, feel warm and natural, and are easier to repair over
                time. Aluminum and vinyl pergolas can work in some situations, but they often feel hotter to the touch
                and can look more like kits than custom structures.<br /><br />
                During your estimate, we’ll <strong>compare cedar vs aluminum pergolas for the Houston climate</strong>,
                explain maintenance, and show real examples so you can decide what fits your style and budget.

                Some small pergolas do not require a city permit, but many Houston neighborhoods and HOAs still require

                As a local <strong>pergola contractor</strong>, we help you understand typical requirements for

                <strong>Pergola builder Houston prices</strong> depend on size, height, wood species, beam spacing,
                footing requirements, roof details and whether we’re integrating the pergola with an outdoor kitchen or
                existing patio cover.<br /><br />
                Many homeowners invest <strong>a few thousand dollars for a simple wood patio pergola</strong>, while
                larger <strong>cedar pergolas</strong> with heavy posts, upgraded beams, lighting or privacy features
                can cost more. During your estimate we provide line-item pricing so you can see how size and options
                change the overall <strong>pergola contractor Houston cost</strong>.

                Off-the-shelf kits sometimes look cheaper on paper, but by the time you adjust sizes, upgrade posts,
                buy hardware and pay for installation, the difference between a kit and a
                <strong>custom pergola built by a local contractor</strong> often shrinks.<br /><br />
                A custom build lets us size posts and beams correctly, match your home’s style, and design for Houston
                wind and sun. If you’re already paying for labor, it usually makes sense to invest in a properly
                engineered custom structure instead of a one-size-fits-all kit.

                In Texas, and especially the Houston area, the cost of a <strong>12x12 pergola</strong> versus a
                <strong>20x20 pergola</strong> depends on wood species, post size, beam layout, height, and whether
                we’re adding lighting, privacy screens or tying into an existing roof.<br /><br />
                A 12x12 wood or cedar pergola typically falls in the <strong>lower to mid range</strong> of our project
                spectrum, while a 20x20 pergola is a larger investment because of the additional lumber, footings and
                structural requirements. We don’t guess—we provide a written estimate so you can see exactly how
                dimensions and options affect your <strong>pergola builder Houston cost</strong>.

                On your first call, ask any pergola contractor about

                for design, HOA approval and material ordering before construction even starts.<br /><br />
                Once permits and approvals are ready, the actual <strong>pergola construction</strong> is usually
                completed in a matter of days, not months, depending on size and weather. We’ll give you a realistic
