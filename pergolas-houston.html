              If you’ve been saving pergola photos on Instagram, but aren’t sure what will work on
              your actual patio, we’ll help you design a custom pergola that fits your home, your
              microclimate and your budget.

              <p>
                Pergola Builder Houston focuses on <strong>custom pergolas in the Houston metro</strong>—
                not generic big-box kits. We build site-specific pergolas that are sized correctly for
                your slab or deck, anchored properly and engineered for the way you actually use the
                space.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether you want a simple <strong>wood pergola</strong> over your existing patio, a
                modern structure that ties into a new outdoor kitchen, or a <strong>pergola extension</strong>
                to make a builder-grade patio finally useful, we design around Houston’s heat, afternoon
                sun angles and heavy rain.

                <li>
                  <strong>Pergola extensions</strong> that expand undersized builder patio covers

                Our team walks your backyard, looks at how the sun hits your patio during the day,
                and recommends pergola layouts, beam spacing and shade options that actually work in
                Houston—rather than just copying a photo from another climate.

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                For Houston, we typically recommend <strong>wood pergolas</strong> built from cedar
                or properly treated lumber. Wood handles heat well, looks warm and can be repaired
                or stained as it ages. Metal and aluminum pergolas can also work, but they often
                feel hotter to the touch and can look more “kit-like.”<br /><br />
                The most important part is how the pergola is <strong>designed and installed</strong>:
                post depth, footing size, hardware and connection details all matter more than a
                brand name. We design pergolas specifically for Houston’s wind, sun and humidity.

                Pricing depends on the size, height, wood species, beam spacing, roof detail and
                whether we’re tying into an outdoor kitchen or existing patio cover.<br /><br />
                Most Houston homeowners we work with invest somewhere between
                <strong>a few thousand dollars for a simple patio pergola</strong> and
                <strong>more for larger cedar pergolas</strong> with upgraded posts, lighting and
                integrated seating. During an estimate, we’ll line-item options so you can see what
                different pergola sizes and details do to the price.

                Yes. A lot of our projects are <strong>pergola extensions</strong> on top of small
                builder slabs or basic covered patios. We’ll look at your existing concrete, measure
                thickness and condition, and determine whether we should anchor to the slab or pour
                new footings just off the edge.<br /><br />
                We can also design <strong>freestanding pergolas</strong> near a pool or detached
                seating area if your current patio isn’t in the right spot.

                Some pergolas in the Houston area are simple enough that they don’t need a formal
                permit, but many neighborhoods and HOAs still require <strong>approval and drawings</strong>
                if you’re changing the appearance of the home or adding posts near the property
                line.<br /><br />
                We’ll help you understand what your HOA is likely to ask for and can provide
                documentation and layout details as needed so your pergola is approved before we
                start.

                Shade depends on <strong>beam spacing, slat orientation and the time of day</strong>.
                We can design pergolas that provide softer, dappled shade or heavier shade by
                adjusting how tight the slats are and which direction they run relative to the sun’s
                path.<br /><br />
                During your estimate, we’ll stand on your patio with you, look at the sun angle and
                talk through how different pergola layouts will feel at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and
                early evening in the Houston summer.

                Absolutely. Many of our Houston pergola projects include <strong>string lighting,
                integrated low-voltage lights, ceiling fans or privacy slat walls</strong>. We can
                rough-in conduit and boxes so your electrician can connect everything cleanly.<br /><br />
                If you know you want fans, heaters or TVs from day one, we’ll design the pergola
                posts and beams to support that added weight and wiring.
