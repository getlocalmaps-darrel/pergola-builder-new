            <p class="section-subtitle">
              League City backyards are a mix of <strong>lake lots, greenbelts and coastal breezes</strong>. Our job as
              your <strong>League City pergola builder</strong> is to design a structure that works with those views and
              winds—something that feels solid, provides shade and looks right with your home and subdivision.
            </p>

            <div class="inner-intro-body">
              <p>
                We regularly build <strong>custom pergolas in League City neighborhoods</strong> like South Shore
                Harbour, Mar Bella, Tuscan Lakes, Westover Park, Hidden Lakes and areas closer to Clear Lake and I-45.
                Every community has its own home styles and HOA guidelines, so we size posts, beams and finishes to your
                home instead of forcing a generic pergola kit.
              </p>
              <p>
                During an on-site visit we’ll review your patio size, pool layout, sun exposure off the bay, and how you
                actually use the space. Then we walk through <strong>cedar pergolas, painted wood pergolas and hybrid
                patio covers</strong>, explaining realistic <strong>League City pergola pricing</strong>, wind
                considerations and timelines so you know what to expect before any work starts.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Custom wood &amp; cedar pergolas</strong> sized for League City patios and lake lots</li>
                <li><strong>Pergolas for outdoor kitchens</strong> and grilling spaces near Clear Lake and Clear Creek</li>
                <li><strong>Pergola extensions</strong> that expand small builder slabs into real outdoor rooms</li>
                <li><strong>Freestanding pergolas</strong> that create a destination closer to the water or side yard</li>
                <li>Help with <strong>League City and HOA approvals</strong> so your pergola is set up to pass on paper</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If you’d like to see options in person, we can point out <strong>pergolas we’ve built in League City,
                Friendswood, Webster and Clear Lake</strong> so you can drive by, see how they look with the homes and
                get ideas for your own project.

                you recognize—South Shore Harbour, Mar Bella, Tuscan Lakes, Hidden Lakes or areas near Clear Lake and

                For most <strong>League City pergolas</strong> we recommend cedar or properly treated wood. These

                <br /><br />
                During your estimate we compare <strong>cedar vs painted wood pergolas</strong>, talk about maintenance
                and show examples so you can choose the look that fits your League City home and neighborhood.

                Smaller wood pergolas are at the lower end of the range, while large cedar pergolas with upgraded
                beams, lighting or privacy screens are a higher investment. A written estimate tailored to your yard is
                the best way to understand exact costs.

                Big-box pergola kits rarely match the scale and style of <strong>League City homes</strong>, especially
                on lake and greenbelt lots that deal with wind and irregular shapes. A <strong>custom pergola</strong>
                can be sized for your patio, furniture and views and built with posts, beams and hardware suited for our
                coastal weather and HOA standards.
                <br /><br />
                When you factor in upgraded materials and professional installation, many League City homeowners find a
                custom pergola is a smarter long-term investment than a basic kit.

                To compare pergola builder prices fairly in League City, ask each contractor for a <strong>written,

                That way you can see exactly where each price comes from and choose the pergola builder who offers the
